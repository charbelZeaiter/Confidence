**A couple of resources to help get you started**  
If you are new to web app dev, then hopefully these will help.  

1. Tomcat and eclipse setup - http://webapps.cse.unsw.edu.au/webcms2/course/index.php?cid=2380
2. Derby Database - http://webapps.cse.unsw.edu.au/webcms2/course/index.php?cid=2380  

So just import via "file System" the project folder (or i think the .war file) into your eclipse into a "Dynamic Web Project".

GOOD LUCK! (also there are some great resources online if you google around!)
