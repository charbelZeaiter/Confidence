Will's Note
Sorry I forgot to mention in the description that I've also changed the way the server is accessed. 
The username would be root and the password would be root. If this is different on your mysql server 
the files you need to change are the studentInterface.jsp and the JDBC java file. Simply change the 
second "root" to null.
